# BrainSeq
Personal Project

This project is a personal exploration, which can be used to demonstrate my skills in Probability Theory, Statistics and Machine Learning.
It is written in a way that can read/understood without a rigorous background.

In this project, I asked for a friend to provide me with a long list of random integers, from 0 to 9. Then, I tried to use tools from Statistics, Probability Theory and ML to
uncover patterns of numbers and see if I can accurately predict the next one in the sequence.
